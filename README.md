# assign_color_to_a_string
Form a set of colors assign a color to each unique string passed to a function in that session of the application.

Just include color_list.js/.json and colorAssigner.js in your application and call the function 'assignColor(string)' to get the unique color for the string provided as a parameter from the set of colors in that session.

To check how it works open index.html in the web browser.

# Note: once you refresh the application context that has the 'assignColor()' function the counter will reset and the colors will be assigned from the beginning.
